# Flower Classification Project

## Overview
This project focuses on the development and refinement of a machine learning model aimed at classifying images of flowers into their respective species. Using a convolutional neural network (CNN), the model is trained to distinguish among various common flower types such as roses, tulips, dandelions, and sunflowers. This project uses a Flowers Recognition dataset from Kaggle 

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes image resizing, normalization, and augmentation to enhance model training.
- **Model Architecture**: Utilizes a CNN with layers designed to extract and learn spatial hierarchies in images.
- **Training and Validation**: Employs a split dataset approach to train the model and validate its accuracy, ensuring generalization.
- **Misclassification Analysis**: Provides tools and techniques for analyzing misclassified images to understand model limitations.
- **Visualization**: Implements matplotlib for plotting predictions against actual labels, aiding in visual assessment of model performance.

## Technologies
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **TensorFlow and Keras**: Used for building and training the deep learning model.
- **NumPy and Matplotlib**: For data manipulation and visualization.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For additional machine learning tools like `LabelEncoder`.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks to train the model, perform predictions, and visualize results.

## Future Scope
- **Enhance Model Accuracy**: Explore more complex architectures and hyperparameter tuning.
- **Expand Dataset**: Include a wider variety of flowers and more nuanced classification categories.
- **Deploy as an Application**: Develop a web or mobile app that allows users to upload flower images and receive instant classification results.
